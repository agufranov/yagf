Client CoffeeScript:
- check speed for large files
- watchify streams are ending immediately
- handle errors with notify
  - now build hangs when error
- debugger is not working
  - now it works (why?), but strange error in browser: '<sourcemap fragment> is not defined'

Livereload after initial build
